The Hénon–Heiles system is a chaotic Hamiltonian system in two degrees of freedom. It describes the planar motion of a particle in a potential 
$$
V(x,y) =  \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2) + (x^2y - \frac{1}{3}y^3).
$$

It was introduced in 1964 to study the existence of additional integrals of motion in galaxy dynamics. For most initial conditions, no such integral of motion exists. Beyond a certain value of the energy, the contours of the potential function "open up" and the particle can escape to infinity through one of three exits.
