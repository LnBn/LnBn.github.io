I am an applied mathematician from Queensland, Australia. I received my PhD in Dynamical Systems from the University of Sydney in 2024. My research interests include transient chaos, Hamiltonian mechanics, and complex systems. I am also an enthusiast of scientific computing, particularly using the Julia programming language. You can find details of some of my work below.
